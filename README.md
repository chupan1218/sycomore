# sycomore
This package provides R implement of `sycomore`. It allows the quantification of the synergy and competition between two miRNAs when they target on the same mRNA, and allows large-scale and fast calculations. 

This package will be sold to Bioconductor one day; but it's not there now so the easiest way to install it is through the `devtools` package:
`install.packages("devtools"); library(devtools);` 
then, install this package through:
`install_github("chupan1218/sycomore"); library(sycomore);`

The function based explanation documentation and application examples are available through the `help`. The other guide is the sycomore vignettes in which you also can get detailed information.
